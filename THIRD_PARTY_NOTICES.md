# Third-party notices

This project's npm dependencies (see `package.json`) are used as-is via npm/pnpm and
carry their own licenses (all permissive: MIT, ISC, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, or
Apache-2.0 — verified with `pnpm licenses list`), which travel with each package and
aren't reproduced here.

The one exception — code copied directly into this repository rather than depended on
— is the icon shape data in `src/icons.ts`, sourced from the Lucide project.

## Lucide

`src/icons.ts` contains SVG path data for icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev).

icons since the fork) are derived from Feather and carry Feather's original license:
